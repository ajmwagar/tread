North Seattle College has many levels of math and English classes to meet a variety of educational and personal goals. All new and current students have the opportunity to take a math and English placement test at North. The test is given on a computer (but does not require experience using a computer).

New Students
Once youâ€™ve completed the admission step and have your SID/PIN#, then pay your fees for testing and check the testing calendar for a time to test. Remember to bring valid photo ID with you.

When To Take the Tests
You do not need to schedule your English or math placement test. You can take English or math or both at the same time. (There is only one fee if you take both together.) Just drop in to the Testing Center to start your test anytime during Placement Testing walk-in hours.
